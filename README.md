> We are provided with _times of abundance_ which enables us to **share with others**.

### About
#### Me
I am an independent *Information Architect* and *Permaculture designer/teacher*. Everything what I do, what I participate, should follow the *Permaculture Ethics*
1. Earth care
2. People care
3. Fair-share[^FairShare]

[^FairShare]: **Fair-share** rules are simple: Taking of what we need and sharing what we don’t whilst recognizing that there are limits to how much we can give and how much we can take.

#### Task
The growth in human **consumption**, waste of **resources**, and the accelerating **extinction** of species make clear the **impossibility** of continuous growth.
Sometimes we need to make hard decisions and consider what enough is.

> #### I believe in the power of **globally connected** **local communities** using F/LOSS[^FLOSS] solutions.

To realize this sustainably, we need:
- [x] transparently secure **resource management**,
- [x] effective collaborative **allocation**,
- [x] and **trust**[^AltruismScore]

[^AltruismScore]:With the help of the ***Altruism Score*** we find the right balance in our own lives to provide positive examples for others, so that they can find their own balance.

1. For the *transparently secure **resource management*** we need cryptographically scalable open-source framework on a reliable hosting
2. For *effective and collaborative allocation* of resources, we need active individuals, communities and organization motivated to share their needs and surpluses
3. **Trust** is provided by the open-source code and community curation, where everyone is encouraged to learn and give back following the Sustainable Development Agenda

#### Work
Our aim **to realize** during this week, to have 
- [ ] a platform, where users able to **share** unused resources and surplus for purchasing, exchanging, or taking unconditionally (aka. free of charge) by default 
    - [ ] with **social media** sharing capabilities,
    - [ ] some basic **gamification** and incentives,
    - [ ] customizable **payment processors**;
- [ ] basic *Resource Mapping* service to have a bigger picture of the supply, support, and aid capacity and needs of members in a secure way
- [ ] communications platform,
    - [ ] where meaningful conversations can happen 
    - [ ] on private and public channels 
    - [ ] with multilingual support,
    - [ ] where related education can happen
    - [ ] for communities to emerge

Today all of these are happening in _WhatsApp_
and _facebook_ groups, or centralized sharing economy is build around. It is time do disrupt the industry!

In short: **We need decentralized federated collaborative economy**!

## :bulb: Idea
**The [eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) of altruism.**[^altruism] A **Trusted F/LOSS marketplace** for *collaborative economy*, where individuals, communities and organisations able to share their *resources, services and needs* in a trusted way for *money*, in *exchange* for other goods and services, or like a *give away*, for free.

> Easy-to-use *F/LOSS* **resource management toolkit** with **trusted marketplace** to sell, exchange or give away goods and services in the name of altruism.

[^altruism]: the principle or practice of unselfish concern for or devotion to the welfare of others (opposed to egoism).
[^Altruist]: a person unselfishly concerned for or devoted to the welfare of others (opposed to egoist).
[^FLOSS]: Free/Libre Open-Source Software; Libre: maintains the software user's civil liberty rights
